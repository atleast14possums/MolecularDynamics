README

The files in this repository are going to be molecular dynamic anaylsis and input files.


ExtractandCompileCapdb.py will generate a C-alpha only .pdb from any existing pdb file for coars grained analysis. 

QnP is a contact analysis script that will provide Q(t) plots with 2 different methods, Best-Hummer and a more straight forward analysis adaptable to different situations. 
As well as a probability heatmap which will have a much better clarity and resolution with Smog-Server contact files.
