README

The files in this repository are going to be primarily simple anaylsis and input files.

mdawh is an mdp file setup for PMF analysis, the mdp will provide a consistent temperature and pressure based off your inputs, this mdp does not make use of simulated annealing. 

DataCompilation is a simple python program to combine multiple output text files of the same format (generally .xvg) into one file for anaylsis, particularly useful with simulations that are paused and restarted.
